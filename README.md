# SuperTicTacToe

Classic TicTacToe game with an AI and a twist, the board connects from the edges. The game will prompt the user for a board size (between 3-9), then prompt for a number of connection to win. The user then chooses if X or O starts. 
The game GUI has an undo button where the user can undo back to the start, as well as reset and exit buttons.
